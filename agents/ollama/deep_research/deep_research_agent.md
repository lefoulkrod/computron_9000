- [x] 1.2 Define the basic Deep Research Agent class
  - [x] Implement agent with appropriate name, description, and model settings
  - [x] Create comprehensive instruction prompt
  - [x] Add logging and callbacks for debugging/tracking

### Phase 2: Basic Research Tools Integration

- [x] 2.1 Core web research capabilities
  - [x] Integrate existing web tools (search_google, get_webpage, get_webpage_summary, html_find_elements)
  - [x] Add proper tool description documentation
  - [x] Implement tool usage tracking for citation

  - [x] Create source categorization functionality
  - [x] Add tools for extracting publication dates and author information

### Phase 3: Architecture Refactoring and Infrastructure

- [x] 3.1 **PRIORITY ARCHITECTURAL REFACTORS**:
  - [x] **Tool Distribution Issues**: The current implementation has all tools in the main `agent.py` and `tracked_tools.py`, but the multi-agent structure expects tools to be distributed to specialized agents

  - [x] **Module Import Dependencies**: Current `tracked_tools.py` imports from global tools, but agent-specific modules should have their own tool implementations
  - [x] **Configuration Management**: Each agent currently uses the same model config - need agent-specific configurations
