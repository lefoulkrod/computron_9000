## Overview

The Deep Research Agent will be a specialized agent within COMPUTRON_9000 focused on conducting thorough research across multiple sources to provide comprehensive, well-sourced answers to complex queries. The agent will:

1. Break down research topics into manageable sub-queries
2. Search and gather information from multiple sources
3. Analyze and synthesize the information
4. Follow citation trails and cross-reference information
5. Provide comprehensive reports with proper citations

## Implementation Plan
