## Multi-Agent Architecture

**Important**: Phase 3.1 has been redesigned as a multi-agent system to address scalability and context management concerns. 

**See complete specifications in**: [`multi_agent_architecture.md`](./multi_agent_architecture.md)

## Implementation Progress

- Phase 1: 100% âœ…
- Phase 2: 67% (Phase 2.3 expanded and pending)
- Phase 3: 10% (Significantly expanded for multi-agent architecture - 6 agents + infrastructure)
- Phase 4: 0% (Expanded for multi-agent testing and optimization)
- Phase 5: 0% (Expanded for multi-agent documentation and deployment)

## Overall Progress: 28%

**Note**: The implementation scope has been significantly expanded to accommodate the multi-agent architecture. While the percentage appears lower, this reflects a much more robust and scalable system design. The multi-agent approach will result in:
- Better context management and scalability
- More maintainable and focused code
- Improved parallel processing capabilities  
- Enhanced specialization for different research tasks
- More flexible and extensible architecture
