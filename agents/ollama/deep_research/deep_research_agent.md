## Current Implementation State Analysis

### Completed Components
- ✅ Single-agent Deep Research Agent with comprehensive toolset
- ✅ Source tracking system with TrackedWebTools and TrackedRedditTools
- ✅ Webpage credibility assessment and metadata extraction 
- ✅ Reddit credibility analysis and sentiment analysis tools
- ✅ Multi-agent directory structure and base agent classes
- ✅ Shared infrastructure (types, storage, communication, workflow coordinator)

### Key Architectural Issues Identified
1. **Tool Distribution Mismatch**: All tools are centralized in `tracked_tools.py` but multi-agent design expects distributed tools
2. **Source Tracker Singleton**: Global source tracker will cause conflicts between agents
3. **Type Definition Fragmentation**: Types scattered across multiple files with potential overlaps
4. **Agent Tool Integration**: Current agents have placeholder tools - need actual tool migration
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Need to maintain single-agent interface while building multi-agent system

### Immediate Refactor Priorities
1. **Phase 3.1.11**: Address tool distribution and source tracker conflicts
2. **Phase 3.2**: Migrate tools to appropriate agent modules 
3. **Phase 4.4**: Consolidate types, imports, and remove duplicated code
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure both single-agent and multi-agent systems work correctly

### Next Steps Recommended
1. **Start with Phase 3.1.11** to resolve architectural conflicts
2. **Implement agent-specific source trackers** to replace global singleton
3. **Begin tool migration** starting with web tools to `web_research/web_tools.py`
4. **Consolidate type definitions** to avoid duplication and conflicts
5. **Add integration tests** to ensure backward compatibility is maintained

## Implementation Progress

- Phase 1: 100% ✅
- Phase 2: 75% (Phase 2.1, 2.1.1, and 2.2 complete; Phase 2.3 pending)
- Phase 3: 35% (Infrastructure complete, tool migration complete, Phase 3.1.3 Research Coordinator implemented, remaining workflow orchestration pending)
- Phase 4: 0% (Expanded for multi-agent testing, optimization, and critical refactoring)
- Phase 5: 0% (Expanded for multi-agent documentation and deployment)

## Overall Progress: 40%

**Note**: Significant progress made on Phase 3.1.11 priority refactors. The multi-agent infrastructure now has proper source tracking, configuration management, and tool interfaces. The legacy single-agent interface maintains backward compatibility while the system is ready for tool migration in Phase 3.2.
- Better context management and scalability
- More maintainable and focused code  
- Improved parallel processing capabilities
- Enhanced specialization for different research tasks
- More flexible and extensible architecture
